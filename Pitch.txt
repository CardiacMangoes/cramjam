What is CramJam?
  CramJam is a program that helps students find study groups for their classes. Users can form study groups with those who are in the same
    class. They can find like minded students in order to prepare for an upcoming exam or homework assignment at a location they agree on. 
  Thanks to the power of Agora's api, this program allows the users to hold video chats in order to perform things such as screen sharing,
    allowing them to view a document together when not congreated at a single area, or one on one tutoring between two users.
